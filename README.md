# Next-Word-Predictor-using-GRU

This project demonstrates a deep learning model for predicting the **next word in a sequence** using an LSTM-based neural network. The training pipeline is implemented in Jupyter Notebook (`experiments.ipynb`), and a clean web interface is built using **Streamlit** (`app.py`).
